          <h5>Create Awareness</h5>
          <p>
            Blockchain is opening up new worlds in the technology space, and
            it’s still in its early days. Being part of the new world will
            create a level playing field for Africans to compete globally. We
            want to make sure Africans won’t miss this train.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h5>Access Education</h5>
          <p>
            Accessing quality education and getting all the resources to excel
            comes at a massive cost that most people cannot afford. We wanted to
            change that; that’s why we decided to provide world-class education
            and resources to everyone for FREE.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h5>Create Jobs</h5>
          <p>
            One of the ways we can improve lives and the economy in Africa is to
            create high paying jobs. That’s why we’re on a mission to reduce
            entry barriers and give people the opportunities to earn a better
            living in the rapidly growing Blockchain industry.
